### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on backend systems at [Survata](https://www.survata.com/)
- 💬 Ask me about Distributed systems, APIs, backend development, Grails, Spring.
- 📫 How to reach me: Shoot me an email if you have it or hit those Twitter DMs at my [profile](https://twitter.com/mlescaille).
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: A SQL query goes into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks, “Can I join you?”

I flew the oceans (🇨🇺 -> 🇺🇾 -> 🇺🇸) so we could meet here at this corner of the internet.
If you like what you read here, you can also visit my website to get a little more of me than code [Mari's personal website](https://www.mlescaille.com/).
